1. Can you identify keywords to which your chatbot responds?
    * Some keywords include "how", "what", "favorite", "hello", "don't", "who", and more.
2. Think of several keywords and the responses they might cause.
    * Keywords like "what is" would trigger some kind of response that starts with "[insert subject here] is [insert definition here]", while "hello" would trigger some kind of greeting.
